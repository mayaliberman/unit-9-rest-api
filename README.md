# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree v2 - REST API Project

## Overview of the Provided Project Files

On this project, I created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

This project is first part of full stack JavaScript application which will be continued by creating the client side with  React  for the REST API.
